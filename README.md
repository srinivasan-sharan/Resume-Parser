# Resume-Parser

This is my attempt at making a resume parser using nltk for natural language processing, I have provided all thhe files I have used for the testing and develepment of the parser.

For the main .py file, please take a look at parser.py file, the other files are for the testing I have done.

I plan on making the pareser better in the future by using spacy for the natural language processing.

Name Accuracy: 27.2%
Phone Number Accuracy: 96.96%
Email Id Accuracy: 93.93%

I am yet to extract other details, such as skills and place of education. I plan on doing the changes soon.

Thank you!
